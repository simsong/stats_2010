Goals of this program:

- We are interested in building a tree of geounits. For each geounit, we want to measure fanout. 

- We want to be able to experiment with different partitioning functions, and to explore partitioning functions that are based on the data

- We want to consider all geographies, inhabited 2010 geographies, and 2010 geographies with housing units or GQ facilities.
