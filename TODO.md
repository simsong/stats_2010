Create an intermediate file describign the tables. Use that to make the schema.

Table language

For each table, define:
 - page number in PDF
 - variable name/description/type
 - variable set including:
   - variable name template
   - variable name range
   - variable name descriptions
   - how to permuate variable names.

Perhaps do this with DDI?
