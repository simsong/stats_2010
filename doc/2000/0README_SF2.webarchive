	About the FTP Application

Â¦	  The application is intended for experienced users of census data, compressed files, and   
spreadsheet/database software. 

Â¦	  FTP users should have a fast file transfer capability. 

Â¦	  Users of the FTP application need to unzip the compressed file after downloading, then import it 
into the spreadsheet/database software of their choice for data analysis and      table presentation.

	Other Sources of the Data

Â¦	American FactFinder at factfinder.census.gov .

	Â¦  This system provides Internet access to all tables plus additional derived tables called Quick 
Tables and Geographic Comparison Tables.

Â¦	The system can create thematic maps on various data items.

Â¦	The system can create reference maps defining the geographic area.

Â¦	Tables are available on American FactFinder on the morning of public release. 


Â¦	DVD/CD-ROM 

	Â¦  CD-ROMs with software are available for individual states on or shortly after the public 
release date. 

Â¦	DVDs are created after all states are released.

Â¦	They can be purchased online ($50 for CD-ROM; $70 for DVD)  from the Census    Catalog  
(www.census.gov, select Census Catalog from left sidebar)  or ordered by telephone from the 
Customer Services Center (301-457-INFO.

Â¦	DVDs and CD-ROMs contain the same software.   

Â¦	Software is  proprietary but are in a format the can easily be imported into data    bases or      
spreadsheets.

Â¦	CD-ROMs with software are available for individual states on or shortly after the public 
release date.  

	File Naming Conventions

Â¦	 The naming convention for geographic header files is ssgeo_uf2.zip

Â¦	ss is USPS state abbreviation

	Â¦  The codes are in technical documentation on page 7-1, located at                    
http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf2.pdf

Â¦	geo_uf2.zip is a constant across SF2 geographic header names.

Â¦	Naming convention for SF2 data files is ssiiiyy_uf2.zip. 

Â¦	ss is USPS state abbreviation

Â¦	iii is the characteristic iteration (total population, race groups, American Indian and Alaska 
Native tribes, and Hispanic/Latino groups)

	Â¦  Characteristic iteration codes are in the Appendix H of the technical documentation, 
which is available at http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/docs/sf2.pdf - page=278.	
		
Â¦	yy is the number of the file

	Â¦  Valid codes are 01 through 04.  See below for distribution of tables across files.

Â¦	_uf2.zip is a constant across SF2 data file names

	Technical Documentation

Â¦	  The complete technical documentation for SF2 is available at                     
	http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf2.pdf .

	Data Records and Segmentation

Â¦   If the total population (iteration 001) for a geographic entity is less than 100, there will be no 
geographic header record and no data records for that area.  

	Â¦    Example:  The population of One Road township, Roberts County, South Dakota is 54.  There will 
        be no records, either geographic header or data, for this area.  

Â¦    If the population for a race, tribe, or Hispanic/Latino group (iterations 002-463) within a            
geographic entity is 100 or greater, geographic header and data records will be present for the 
group.  

	Â¦  Example:  The Black or African American alone population for Bremer County, Iowa is 110.  There 
     will be a geographic header record and data records for the Black/African American iteration            
     (iteration 004) for this area.  

Â¦	If the population for a race, tribe, or Hispanic/Latino group (iterations 002-463) within a 
geographic entity is less than 100, geographic header and data records will not be present 
for that group.  

	Â¦  Example:  The Hispanic/Latino population for South Harding CCD, Harding County, 
New Mexico is 19.  There will be no data records for the Hispanic/Latino iteration 
(iteration 400) for this area.  


Â¦	Table distribution across data files is as follows:

		
	File name			Number 			Starting 		Ending
				of data 			matrix		matrix
				items			 number		number 
	
	
	ssiii01_uf2		219			PCT1		PCT4
									
	ssiii02_uf2		236			PCT5		PCT19	
				
	ssiii03_uf2		174			PCT20		PCT36

	ssiii04_uf2		137			HCT1		HCT11


Â¦	Five fields are carried over from the geographic header file into each data file. 

Â¦	These fields are file identification (FILEID), state abbreviation (STUSAB),        
characteristic iteration (CHARITER), characteristic iteration file sequence           number 
(CIFSN) and logical record number (LOGRECNO). 

	Â¦  These five fields appear in the geographic header record are in a fixed field format.  

Â¦	These five fields appear in the four data files in a comma delimited format.  

Â¦	These fields are used to "match" records in the four data files for a particular      
characteristic iteration to the geographic information in the geoheader.  

Â¦	A file set structure schematic appears in the technical documentation (page 2-4)  which is 
located at http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf2.pdf

	File Record Layout
	
Â¦  For a layout of the individual tables for each file, see the technical documentation at 
www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf2.pdf .  Select Chapter 6, Summary Table Outlines.  

FTP File Transfer

Â¦	Summary File 2 (SF2) FTP directory is at ftp2.census.gov/census_2000/datasets/Summary_File_2 . 

Â¦	 Each state directory provides all files available for the identified state. 

Â¦	 The directory for each state has a geographic header file and four files for each   iteration 
(total population, race, tribe, or Hispanic/Latino group) having a population of 100 or 
more.

Â¦	 There is a potential (but not likely) for 1,000 files for each stateâ€”one geographic header 
file and four data for each of the 250 iterations. This occurs only when each of the 250 
groups has a population of 100 or more.  

Â¦	The chart on page 3 of this document lists the table numbers available in each of the four 
files.  

Â¦	Once uncompressed, the files are in a flat ASCII format.

Â¦	No software is provided.

Â¦	Downloading multiple files

Â¦	UNIX environmentâ€”"mget" subcommand allows transfer of multiple files using the 
wildcard character.  
	Â¦  Example:  ftp&gt; prompt off
ftp&gt;mget ne*  (for this example, Nebraska is selected). 

Â¦	Windows Environmentâ€”many FTP products have been developed which have the 
capability to download multiple files with a single command.  

Â¦	We used the ws_ftp product in testing the download.

	Â¦  A demonstration copy is available at http://www.ipswitch.com/  .                      
     
Â¦	An Internet search using the term "download multiple files" yielded other similar 
products.  

Â¦	For step-by-step instructions with screen shots, please see 
http://www.census.gov/support/2000/SF2/  ..

	Unzipping the Files	

Â¦	Files compress at approximately 95% compression.

Â¦	Any standard UnZIP software package can be used.

Â¦	In testing we used PKZIP for Windows.  It's available at www.pkware.com. .

Â¦	Unzipped file is in flat ASCII format.

Â¦	For step-by-step instructions with screen shots, please see 
http://www.census.gov/support/2000/SF2/  .


	Unzipped Files

Â¦	  Geographic header file has fixed fields.

Â¦	  File data dictionary is at  http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf2.pdf . See chapter 7 for the 
data dictionary.  

Â¦	 Data files (files 01-04) have comma delimited fields

Â¦	Fields from the geographic header file carried over to the data files are comma   
delimited in the data files .

	Spreadsheet and Data Base Aids

Â¦	 For step-by-step instructions with screen shots for moving the data and structure to a spreadsheet, 
please see www.census.gov/support/SF2ASCII.html .  

Â¦	Structure files in Access97 and other formats are available at 
http://www.census.gov/support/2000/SF2/ .  

Â¦	We are unable to provide one-on-one support for applications of the data to specific       
spreadsheets or data base software.

	Maximum File Sizes

Â¦	The figures below are the maximum file sizes for SF2 and are identical to the sizes for   SF1.  

Â¦	Size of state files will vary considerably from these figures, depending on the number of  total 
population, race, tribe, or Hispanic/Latino groups within the state having a population of 100 or 
over.  

Â¦	As state tables are run, we will update this listing.
